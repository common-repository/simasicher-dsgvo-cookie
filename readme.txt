== Description ==

= Block all cookies without consent and customize the cookie note as you wish. =

The SimaCookie plugin adapts your website to the new requirements regarding the GDPL.
In addition, you can customize the note texts and presentation.
With a pop-up, your users will be informed according to your specifications and can decide on the cookie application.
The cookie plugin remembers the user's decision either for the current session or for an adjustable time.

The SimaCookie plugin extends the <a href="http://peadig.com/wordpress-plugins/eu-cookie-law/"> EU Cookie Law</a> plugin with more cookie hints:

* Overlay that prevents the user from accessing the page without the consent of cookies
* Bar bottom and top

In addition, you can now provide the designated cookies with categories and explain them in more detail with notes.
